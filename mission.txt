Event Loop & Async Programming:
Explore how the event loop, microtasks, and macrotasks work.
Learn about Promises, async/await, and their internal mechanisms.
Resources: MDN: Asynchronous JavaScript
Day 3-4: Memory Management and JavaScript Performance

Memory Allocation and Garbage Collection: How variables are stored and cleaned up in JS.
Prototypes & Inheritance: Learn how JavaScript uses prototypes and how inheritance is implemented internally.
The V8 Engine (Chrome): Get an overview of the V8 engine and how JS is compiled.
Resources: V8 Blog
Day 5-6: Advanced JavaScript Concepts

Event Bubbling, Capturing, and Delegation: How JS event handling works.
Module Systems (ES6 Modules, CommonJS): Learn how JavaScript handles module imports/exports.
Error Handling: Understand try-catch, async error handling, and common patterns.
Performance Optimization: Learn common performance pitfalls in JavaScript.
Day 7: Coding Challenges and Application

Solve coding challenges related to closures, async programming, and event handling.
Practice on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank.
Week 2: React Under the Hood
Day 1-2: React Component Lifecycle & Rendering

Understand React’s component lifecycle and rendering process.
Learn how React handles reconciliation and the Virtual DOM.
Hooks under the hood: How useState, useEffect, and others work.
Resources: React Documentation
Day 3-4: React Performance Optimization

Learn techniques like memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback).
Profiling React applications using the React Developer Tools.
Understanding the difference between functional and class components performance-wise.
Day 5-6: React Concurrent Mode and Fiber Architecture

Understand how React’s Fiber architecture improves rendering performance.
Learn about concurrent rendering and how React schedules updates.
Read through React’s official blog posts on Fiber architecture.
Resources: React Fiber Architecture
Day 7: Hands-on React Projects

Build a React project from scratch (use Vite for a lightweight setup).
Implement advanced hooks, error boundaries, and optimization techniques.
Week 3: Browser Internals and Networking
Day 1-2: How Browsers Work

Learn the internal workings of a browser (e.g., parsing, rendering, painting).
Explore the critical rendering path (from HTML to pixels on the screen).
Resources: How Browsers Work
Day 3-4: Networking in the Browser

Understand HTTP(S) protocols, request lifecycle, and response caching.
Dive into CORS, cookies, and headers (security aspects like CSRF, XSS).
Explore RESTful APIs and how the browser handles networking.
Tools: Postman
Day 5-6: Web Performance Optimization

Learn about techniques like lazy loading, compression (gzip/brotli), and service workers.
Explore tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance analysis.
Understand Time to First Byte (TTFB), Content Delivery Networks (CDN), and server-side rendering (SSR).
Day 7: Hands-on Networking & Performance

Create a React app that fetches data from an API and focuses on optimizing the loading time (use Chrome DevTools to analyze).
Simulate different network conditions (throttling) and optimize accordingly.
Week 4: Mock Interviews and Projects
Day 1-2: Mock Interviews and Coding Challenges

Practice mock interviews focusing on JavaScript, React, and browser/networking concepts.
Solve algorithmic challenges (focus on array, string manipulation, and async operations).
Day 3-4: Build a Full-Stack App

Create a small React app that fetches data from an external API (e.g., weather, movie database).
Focus on good coding practices, performance optimization, and networking.
Day 5-6: Review and Strengthen Weak Areas

Review concepts that you found challenging over the last few weeks.
Revisit coding challenges and mock interviews to refine your responses.
Day 7: Rest and Final Prep

Light review of major concepts.
Go over interview questions focusing on JavaScript and React internals.
